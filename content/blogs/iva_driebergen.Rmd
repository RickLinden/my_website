# Automotive Business Management undergraduate.

For my undergraduate I chose to do automotive business management at the IVA Driebergen in The Netherlands. The automotive focus, wide subject range and social skill development were the main reasons I went to this Business School.

During my studies here I have been a treasurer at the student association, student ambassador and have volunteered to represent companies on fairs as sales representative.
