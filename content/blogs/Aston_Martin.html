<h1>Aston Martin</h1>
<p>My first contact with Aston Martin was as an intern at the merchandise department. Under CEO Dr. Andy Palmer, the company wanted to diversify their brand, to go from an automotive brand to a global luxury brand. When I came into the company the merchandise was being developed. I got the opportunity to develop the data infrastructure. Collecting, analysing and reporting of saels data was a big part of my internship.</p>
<p>This internship turned into a permanent role not long after I graduated at IVA Business School. With my permanent role I took on more data analytical jobs and my role would be expanded to include Licensing. I gained a lot of analytical and reporting skills. Licensing brought me experience with account management and licensing contracts.</p>
<p>A couple of highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced Aston martin’s IPO</li>
<li>Supported AM Partnerships team at the 24hr Le Mans race</li>
<li>Set up till systems in Global AM brand centres</li>
</ul>
